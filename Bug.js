This error occurs when you are using a component that expects a specific type of prop, but you are passing it a different type. For example, if a component expects a number prop but you pass it a string, you'll see this error. This is often caused by typos in prop names, incorrect data fetching or transformations, or simply passing the wrong type of data.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
<MyComponent myNumberProp="10" />

// Correct usage
<MyComponent myNumberProp={10} />
```
